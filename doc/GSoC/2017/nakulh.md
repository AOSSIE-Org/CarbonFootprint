Working with awesome mentors fellow students made my summer super productive.

I have contributed to project [Carbon Footprint](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint).
<strong> Project URL </strong> : https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint

The team member with me in this project was [vaibsharma](https://gitlab.com/vaibsharma) .

The goals I completed during GSoC 2017 are :-

* <strong>Adding support for calculating carbon emission of trains on websites that sell train tickets</strong>

	<i>Related MRs </i> :

	* [basic ability to calculate emissions of trains and processing code for sncf](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/196)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>  : Added main logic for calculating emission of trains and support for 1 website.

	* [Support for thalys, tgv-lyria, ouigo, and eurostar](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/200)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>  : Added support for 4 more websites.

* <strong>Basic flight emission calculation logic adding more flights website in the extension.</strong>

	<i>Related MR </i> :
  * [Flights](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/194)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>  : Basic logic which was improved by vaibsharma.

  * [Support for more flights websites](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/206)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>  : Added more websites that sell flight tickets.

* <strong>Making module for knowing when the extension has failed</strong>

	<i>Related MRs </i> :
	* [Know when extension fails](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/204)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>  : all the basic logic

	* [Sentry.io integration (resubmit)](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/213)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>  : Add server integration so we are notified when extension has failed

* <strong>Enhancing the flight emission calculator.</strong>

  <i>Related MR </i> :
  * [Added more airplanes to json and added code for extrapolation.](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/215)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>

  * [calculator of CO2 emission of flights in knowmore page.](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/211)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong> Added a calculator to knomore.html page

  * [Display emission according to flight seat type (economy or business).](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/219)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong> Added support for different seat types in an airplane.

* <strong>Enhancing code.</strong>

	<i>Related MR </i> :
	* [Refactoring code.](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/217)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>: deleted a lot of duplicate code

	* [Fixes code duplication in flight emission calculation form.](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/218)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong> Improved code for calculator

* <strong>Writing tests.</strong>

    <i>Related MR </i> :
    * [Tests for validator, trains and flights and minor code refactor.](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/220)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>

    * [test for inform.js callback function.](https://gitlab.com/aossie/CarbonFootprint/merge_requests/223)  <strong><i>Merged</i></strong>
